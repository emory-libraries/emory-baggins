CHANGELOG
=========

Release 0.5
-----------


* As a bagger, I want to run a script based on one or more individual IDs
  from the DigWF database, so that I can target selected content to Bag.
* As a bagger, I want to be able to install a script using provided
  instructions, so that I don't require personal technical support at the
  time of installation.
* As a bagger, I want to select a location for the output for the bags
  so that I can specify where the bags should be stored.
* As a bagger, I need to configure environments and source files, so
  that I can access the correct servers and data sources.
* As a bagger, I want to run a script based on a supplied file containing
  many IDs, so that I can target selected content to bag.
* As a bagger of LSDI books, I want all .tif, .pos, .txt, .pdf, and .xml
  (ABBYY Finereader) files to be added to the bag payload, so that all data
  comprising a digitized book is included in the bag.
* As a bagger, I want to record the bagit version and character encoding used
  when creating the bag, so that my bags conform to the bagit specification.
* As a bagger, I want md5 and sha256 checksums to be generated for all payload
  (data) and metadata files in the bag, so that file fixity can be preserved.
* As a bagger of LSDI books, I want MARCXML records for the digitized volume to
  be added to the bag, so that sufficient descriptive metadata is included.
* As a bagger, I want to record summary information about the source
  organization contained in the bag, so that we know who owns the content.
* As a bagger of LSDI books, I want to record notes about external relationships
  regarding collection membership and related book object in Fedora, so that
  those relationships are clear and explicit inside the bag.
